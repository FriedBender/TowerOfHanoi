    make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction),
    make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction),
    make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction),
    repeat until complete.

For an odd number of disks:

In each case, a total of 2n âˆ’ 1 moves are made.
